## Structure

* Built on Electron + React + TypeScript
* NHApp is based on a fork of [Rectron](https://github.com/Maks1mio/Rectron), which serves as the technical foundation of the application. Significant changes were made to the architecture and user interface during development.
* Uses [nhentai-api](https://github.com/Zekfad/nhentai-api) ‚Äî a slightly modified version by me (not an official API)
